# Udacity-Enron-Machine-Learning
Machine learning project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
# Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Person Of Interest (POI) identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.

In order to build this identifier a dataset is analyzed using machine learning algorithms. This dataset contains a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
